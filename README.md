# Retinotopy


## Structure directories 

In this structure it is not important if the data was adquired in different sessions. All the run that you want
to include go inside the **bold** folder

<br/>

```
retinotopy
    |--sessid (empty file with the names of subjects (SUBJ01)
    |--SUBJ01
        |--subjectname (empty file with the name of the structural correspondence)
        |--bold
            |--001 (run)
                |--f.nii (functional file)
                |--rtopy.par
            |--002
                |--f.nii
                |--rtopy.par
               
 ```
